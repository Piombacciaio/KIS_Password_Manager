# Keep It Simple [aka KIS] password manager

So... Tonight I wasn't able to catch sleep so my brilliant idea,
instead of trying to sleep, was to code a password manager because why not?

This isn't honestly made to be an unbreakable thing that will protect you passwords
against everyone and everything I did it just for fun and to experiment a bit with
cryptography, otp and hashing

Hope you find this somewhat useful and lmk in case you do something cool with it

## Requirements

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip requirements (`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`)

## Notes

When run the first time, the script will create a folder in C: drive called `KIS Password Manager`, if you don't want to delete it yourself `delete.bat` will do for you (it won't ask for confirmation so copy anything you may want to keep before running)
